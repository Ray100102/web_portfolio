                    <div class = "modal-subtitle">Overview</div>
                    <p>Battlecode, MIT's annual AI programming competition, spans a month with changing themes.
                        Teams of up to four submit their bots on the website, engaging in virtual battles using an ELO rating system.
                        The season includes four online competitions: Sprint 1, Sprint 2, Qualifying tournaments, and the final tournament.
                        The top 12 US and leading 4 International teams compete at MIT for prizes over $20,000 in the final week.</p>
                    <p>
                    <div class = "modal-subtitle">Process</div>
                    <p>The core of the project involved the development of efficient grid pathing algorithms.
                        These algorithms were engineered to facilitate optimal navigation for the robotic system.
                        Rigorous testing and optimization ensured that the chosen pathing algorithms were both reliable and efficient,
                        contributing to the overall effectiveness of the robotic navigation system.</p>

                    <p> Robotic state management was a pivotal aspect of the project, requiring careful consideration and precision.
                        The state management system was designed to handle the diverse states and transitions of the robotic system seamlessly.
                        This component played a crucial role in maintaining a clear and organized structure for decision-making processes.</p>

                    <p>Decision-making systems were implemented to enhance the autonomy of the robotic system.
                        These systems were intricately designed to analyze information from the environment, interpret it, and make informed decisions.
                        The efficiency of the decision-making process was a key focus, ensuring the robotic system could adapt to dynamic situations in real-time.</p>

                    <p>Throughout the development process, version control played a vital role in maintaining project integrity and collaboration.
                        Four intense week long sprints were executed, with version control systems effectively managing code changes and ensuring a cohesive development environment.
                        The result was the successful delivery of a project boasting 4,000 lines of code,
                        reflecting the collaborative effort and meticulous planning invested in the development process.</p>

                    <div class = "modal-subtitle">Overview</div>
                    <p>The creation of the UW campus map involved a meticulous process of designing modular components, each rigorously tested to ensure reliability and efficiency.
                        These components encompassed a versatile graph class, a dedicated campus map class, a backend Java Spark server, and frontend elements built in React.</p>
                    <div class = "modal-subtitle">Process</div>
                    <p>During the development phase, Dijkstra's algorithm takes center stage as the key mechanism for calculating the shortest paths between
                        various building locations on the UW Seattle campus.
                        This algorithm, known for its effectiveness in finding the shortest path in a weighted graph, is harnessed to ensure accurate and
                        efficient route calculations within the application</p>

                    <p>In the React component implementation, we incorporated an image of the campus map, mapping each coordinate point to the respective x and y coordinates on the map.
                        Leveraging the power of two threads in the Spark Java component, we successfully retrieved a comprehensive list of buildings along with their
                        corresponding coordinates. To enhance user experience, we implemented two dropdown menus on the client side, allowing clients to effortlessly choose
                        their starting location and destination. This design choice effectively prevented the occurrence of invalid inputs from the client side.
                        The backend seamlessly processed the request, returning a list of coordinates representing the shortest path.
                        This information was then dynamically utilized to update the webpage, visually displaying the optimal path on the campus map image.</p>

                    <div class = "modal-subtitle">Overview</div>
                    <p>The project entails the proficient design, implementation, and optimization of essential data structures using Java.
                        Noteworthy structures include a chaining hash table, a min heap, and an AVL tree. These structures are seamlessly integrated into the backend of a robust chat application.
                        The chat application, as a result, boasts advanced functionalities, including word suggestion, spelling correction, and auto-completion.</p>
                    <div class = "modal-subtitle">Process</div>
                    <p>In the implementation phase, the focus is on crafting efficient data structures.
                    The chaining hash table employs a robust hashing technique for enhanced data organization and retrieval speed.
                    The min heap prioritizes operations based on urgency, contributing to swift processing within the application.</p>

                    <p>The technical implementation of the AVL tree is crucial. This self-balancing binary search tree ensures optimal performance by automatically maintaining
                    balance during insertions and deletions. This balancing act significantly enhances search operation efficiency within the chat application</p>

                    <p> Moving to the backend integration, the chaining hash table powers the word suggestion feature,
                    predicting and offering relevant words during conversations. Simultaneously, the min heap contributes to the application's responsiveness,
                    especially in tasks prioritizing urgency.</p>

                    <p>The project's success lies in the efficient implementation of these data structures.
                    The technical nuances of the AVL tree and optimized hashing techniques significantly impact the backend,
                    ultimately enhancing the user experience in the feature-rich chat application.</p>

                    <div class = "modal-subtitle">Overview</div>
                    <p>Imported and managed a Flight Database on Azure, enabling user registration and flight bookings through a Java terminal.
                        Implemented a 2-phase locking mechanism for concurrent bookings, ensuring data integrity with prioritized security using hashed and salted passwords.
                        Demonstrates proficiency in database management, Java programming, and user-centric design.
                        The process involved rigorous attention to detail and security considerations.</p>
                    <div class = "modal-subtitle">Process</div>
                    <p> As a key part of the project, I imported a Flight Database onto Azure, incorporating separate schemas for user information and
                        flight reservations. User registrations seamlessly integrated with the database, and upon logging into the Java terminal, users could efficiently
                        explore and book flights based on specified city parameters.</p>

                    <p> To handle concurrent flight bookings by multiple users, a 2-phase locking mechanism with commit and rollback functionality was implemented.
                        This mechanism ensured data consistency during transactions. Transactions initiated upon user access to the database, progressing to the commit phase only
                        upon the successful completion of all database changes. In cases of unsuccessful commits, the system seamlessly rolled back to the transaction's initial state,
                        facilitating a retry mechanism.</p>

                    <p> =The database structure was designed with precision, featuring key tables and well-defined relationships.
                        User authentication prioritized security, employing robust hashing and salting techniques for password protection.
                        Concurrency control measures were implemented to manage simultaneous user interactions, preventing conflicts and ensuring data integrity.
                        Integration with Azure services optimized data transfer and leveraged the platform's capabilities.</p>
