                    <div class = "modal-subtitle">Overview</div>
                    <p> Battlecode, MIT's annual AI programming competition, spans just over a month with changing themes every year.
                        Teams of up to four submit their bots on the website, engaging in virtual battles using an ELO rating system.
                        The season includes four online competitions: Sprint 1, Sprint 2, Qualifying tournaments, and the final tournament.
                        The top 12 US and leading 4 International teams are flown out to compete at MIT for prizes over $20,000 in the final week.</p>
                    <p>
                    <div class = "modal-subtitle">Process</div>
                    <p>The core of the project involved the development of efficient grid pathing algorithms, such as Bellman-Ford and Bugnav.
                        These algorithms were engineered to facilitate optimal navigation for the robotic system.
                        Rigorous testing and optimization ensured that the chosen pathing algorithms were both reliable and efficient,
                        contributing to the overall effectiveness of the robotic navigation system.</p>

                    <p> Robotic state management was a pivotal aspect of the project, requiring careful consideration and precision.
                        Whether a bot was in combat mode, in heal mode, was in a state to go to a certain location, etc. were all critical in victory.
                        The state management system was designed to handle the diverse states and transitions of the robotic systems.
                        This component played a crucial role in maintaining a clear and organized structure for decision-making processes.</p>

                    <p> Decision-making systems were implemented to enhance the autonomy of the robotic system.

                    <h2>Pacman AI</h2>
                    <div class = "modal-subtitle">Overview</div>
                    <p>Developed a Python-based AI agent for Pacman, focusing on efficient pathfinding through mazes and optimizing food collection.
                        The project leveraged various search algorithms, including DFS, BFS, and A*, to influence the path of the Pacman agent.
                        Additionally, the implementation incorporated minimax and expectimax algorithms to enhance Pacman's
                        AI strategy, specifically in dealing with ghosts. The project also simulated the environment as an unknown Markov Decision Process,
                        facilitating intelligent decision-making through reinforcement learning techniques.
                    </p>

                    <div class = "modal-subtitle">Process</div>
                    <p>The foundation of the project involved designing a Pacman AI agent capable of navigating through mazes and collecting food efficiently.
                    The implementation was carried out in Python, utilizing the strengths of the language for AI-related tasks.</p>

                    <p> The pathfinding aspect of the project was tackled through the integration of search algorithms.
                    Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), and A* were employed to influence the movement of the Pacman agent within the maze.
                    These algorithms played a crucial role in determining optimal paths, contributing to the efficiency of food collection.</p>

                    <p>In addition to pathfinding, strategic decision-making against ghosts was addressed using minimax and expectimax algorithms.
                    These decision-making algorithms were exploited to enhance Pacman's ability to navigate the maze while anticipating and countering the actions of ghosts.
                    The incorporation of these algorithms added a layer of intelligence to Pacman's overall strategy.</p>

                    <p> The Markov Decision Process is utilized to model the decision-making process of Pac-Man in its environment.
                        An MDP consists of a set of states, actions, transition probabilities, and rewards. States represent different configurations of the game,
                        actions are the possible moves Pac-Man can make, transition probabilities describe the likelihood of moving from one state to another after taking an action,
                        and rewards quantify the desirability of reaching a particular state.
                        By employing MDPs, Pac-Man's AI can make optimal decisions by considering the current state,
                        available actions, and potential rewards associated with those actions.
                        This allows for intelligent and strategic gameplay, where Pac-Man learns to navigate the maze, avoid ghosts,
                        and collect pellets efficiently based on the principles of reinforcement learning.</p>

                    <p>The iterative development process involved testing and refining the AI agent's performance using different scenarios and maze configurations.
                    The goal was to create an AI agent that not only efficiently collected food but also demonstrated strategic prowess in dealing with dynamic and
                    unpredictable ghost movements.</p>

                    <h2 class = "modal-title">Multithreaded Web Server</h2>
                    <p>The project involves the development of an In-Memory File System Search Engine in C, leveraging a doubly linked list to implement a chained hash table.
                        The combination of these data structures ensures efficient collision resolution and dynamic storage of key-value pairs. The In-Memory File System Search Engine
                        enables rapid retrieval of files and content within the file system.
                        Additionally, a multithreaded web server is developed to showcase the functionality of the search engine,
                        concurrent and responsive access to search results.</p>
                    <div class = "modal-subtitle">Process</div>
                    <p>The project initiation involved the development of a doubly linked list in C, serving as a dynamic and versatile data structure.
                    This list became the basis for the subsequent implementation of a chained hash table, specifically designed for efficient collision
                    resolution and the dynamic storage of key-value pairs. The selection of these foundational components was strategic, aiming to establish a
                    robust infrastructure capable of addressing the complexities inherent in an In-Memory File System Search Engine.</p>

                    <p>Expanding on the established data structures, the development process transitioned to the creation of the In-Memory File System Search Engine.
                    Leveraging the capabilities of the implemented chained hash table, this component facilitated rapid file and content retrieval within the file system.
                    The design emphasized efficiency and practicality in managing and accessing files within the system.</p>

                    <p>As a demonstration of the In-Memory File System Search Engine's capabilities, the project extended to the development of a
                    multithreaded web server in C. This server, designed for concurrent access, provided users with responsive and simultaneous access
                    to search results. The multithreaded architecture showcased the engine's applicability in handling real-world scenarios with diverse
                    and concurrent user interactions.</p>

                    <p>The final stages of the development process focused on the seamless integration of components into a cohesive system.
                    Rigorous testing validated the functionalities, performance, and responsiveness of both the In-Memory File System Search
                    Engine and the multithreaded web server. Optimization efforts addressed potential performance bottlenecks, refining the
                    implementation for enhanced efficiency. Additionally, security measures were implemented to fortify the integrity of the entire system,
                    ensuring a robust and secure solution for file system management and retrieval. The resulting project stands as an exemplar of
                    strategic data structure utilization and technical implementation to deliver an efficient solution for file system operations.</p>

                    <div class = "modal-subtitle">Overview</div>
                    <p>The creation of the UW campus map involved a process of designing modular components, each rigorously tested to ensure reliability and efficiency.
                        These components encompassed a versatile graph class, a dedicated campus map class, a backend Java Spark server, and frontend elements built in React.</p>
                    <div class = "modal-subtitle">Process</div>
                    <p>During the development phase, Dijkstra's algorithm takes center stage as the key mechanism for calculating the shortest paths between
                        various building locations on the UW Seattle campus.
                        This algorithm, known for its effectiveness in finding the shortest path in a weighted graph, is harnessed to ensure accurate and
                        efficient route calculations within the application</p>

                    <p>In the React component implementation, we incorporated an image of the campus map, mapping each coordinate point to the respective x and y coordinates on the map.
                        Leveraging the power of two threads in the Spark Java component, we successfully retrieved a comprehensive list of buildings along with their
                        corresponding coordinates. To enhance user experience, we implemented two dropdown menus on the client side, allowing clients to effortlessly choose
                        their starting location and destination. This design choice effectively prevented the occurrence of invalid inputs from the client side.
                        The backend seamlessly processed the request, returning a list of coordinates representing the shortest path.
                        This information was then dynamically utilized to update the webpage, visually displaying the optimal path on the campus map image.</p>

                    <div class = "modal-subtitle">Overview</div>
                    <p> Imported and managed a Flight Database on Azure, enabling user registration and flight bookings through a Java terminal.
                        Implemented a 2-phase locking mechanism for concurrent bookings, ensuring data integrity with prioritized security using hashed and salted passwords.
                        Demonstrates proficiency in database management, Java programming, and user-centric design.
                        The process involved rigorous attention to detail and security considerations.</p>
                    <div class = "modal-subtitle">Process</div>
                    <p> As a key part of the project, I imported a Flight Database onto Azure, incorporating separate schemas for user information and
                        flight reservations. User registrations seamlessly integrated with the database, and upon logging into the Java terminal, users could efficiently
                        explore and book flights based on specified city parameters.</p>

                    <p> To handle concurrent flight bookings by multiple users, a 2-phase locking mechanism with commit and rollback functionality was implemented.
                        This mechanism ensured data consistency during transactions. Transactions initiated upon user access to the database, progressing to the commit phase only
                        upon the successful completion of all database changes. In cases of unsuccessful commits, the system seamlessly rolled back to the transaction's initial state,
                        facilitating a retry mechanism.</p>

                    <p> The database structure was designed with precision, featuring key tables and well-defined relationships.
                        User authentication prioritized security, employing robust hashing and salting techniques for password protection.
                        Concurrency control measures were implemented to manage simultaneous user interactions, preventing conflicts and ensuring data integrity.
                        Integration with Azure services optimized data transfer and leveraged the platform's capabilities.</p>
